In this repository, I have put together my homework assignments for the time series cross section regression analysis course in HSE Economic Department. 

* *Homework 1* was focused on basic models in TSCS: usual pull model (which does not take into account the temporal data structure), the basic fixed effects and random effects model were evaluated, models were compared and additional specifications were evaluated.
* *Homework 2* was a reflection paper Reflection paper on Juha Tapio Kaariainen "Trust in the Police in 16 European Countries : A Multilevel Analysis" (in russian)
* *Homework 3* was about basic instrumental variable models
